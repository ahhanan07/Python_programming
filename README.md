# Programming Foundations In Python


This repository holds projects developed in the unit Programming Foundations in Python - FIT9133 from the Master of Data Science at Monash University 1/2019 which provided understanding of program design and implementation of algorithms to solve computational problems. Two of the projects developed are:

## Nerd Score Calculator: 
Implementation of a functioning program that allows individuals to calculate their ‘nerd skill level’. Includes a menu that allow sthe program to be    used, an equation which can be used to calculate the score, and a printout that allows a summation of the results.

## Building a Text Parser:
Object-oriented programming task involving XML text parsing without the use of libraries. The parser is able to perform basic data extraction, statistical analysis on a number of linguistic features and also to present the analysis results using some form of visualization.

Some of the knowledge exposed in this projects:

Object Oriented Programming
File Manipulation, Testing and Exception Handling
Data Structures, Collective Data Types and Control Structures
Concepts of Decomposition and Abstract Data Types
